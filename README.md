## Projects
This section will showcase the semester projects:
1. [Project 1](./Project1/README.md): The aim of this project is to implement the Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting along with backward substitution to solve the equation `Ax = b`, where `A` is a `n x n` square matrix.
2. [Project 2](./Project2/README.md): This project involves the implementation of the normalized power iteration algorithm in combination with deflation to find two eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvector for the dominant eigenvalue of a square matrix, `A`. 
3. [Project 3](./Project3/README.md): Implementing secant and bisection algorithms in order to solve ùëì(ùë•) = 0 for any given polynomial f. Take the coefficients of the function, initial guesses and the tolerance value as command line arguments and return the resulting values of x as well as the numbers of iterations for each method.
