## Projects
This section will showcase the semester projects:
1. [Project 1](./Project1/README.md): The aim of this project is to implement the Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting along with backward substitution to solve the equation `Ax = b`, where `A` is a `n x n` square matrix.
2. [Project 2](./Project2/README.md): *Description of Project 2*
3. [Project 3](./Project3/README.md): *Description of Project 3*
